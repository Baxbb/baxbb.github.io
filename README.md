Hello! All of the secrets are in the secrets directory, but I'd very much prefer you'd not peek.
They should all be findable, but if you *really* want to see them, I can't stop you.
Have fun, the website I made with this is mostly just for funsies.
I plan to translate into other languages and such, some planned ones are just ones I know already like:
 * toki pona (latin writing system like this)
 * toki pona (but sitelen pona, using ucsur. 󱥬󱦖󱥔󱤀)
 * Esparanto
 * My conlang, Glo'thush (It's not finished as of now)
 * Really any language I can wrap my head around
